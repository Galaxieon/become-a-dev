                        Object Oriented Programming simplifies the software
                        development and maintenance by providing some concepts
                        such as objects, classes, data abstraction, data
                        encapsulation, modularity, inheritance, polymorphism.
                        Let us discuss these concepts in detail.

                    <p>
                        A <span>class</span> is a prototype/ blueprint that
                        defines data and functions common to all objects of a
                        particular type. <span>Object</span> is an instance of a
                        class with a unique set of data and functions as
                        members. <span>Class</span> is an
                        <span>abstract data type</span> and
                        <span>objects</span> are <span>variables</span> declared
                        using a class. <span>Student is a class</span> with
                        admission number, name and fee as data members.
                        <span>Anil may be an object </span> of this class with
                        values 1203, "Anil Kumar" , and 2000 for these data
                        members. Setting these values to these data members is a
                        function.

                            show that area() is an overloaded function.
